### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been an Android developper for more than a decade, and I'm always learning new stuff. The subjects that interest me deeply at the moment are : Jetpack Compose, KSP, Gradle plugins and many more !

I've contributed to some projects on Github and plan to contribute more when I have the time.
