### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been an Android developper for more than a decade, and I'm always learning new stuff. The subjects that interest me deeply at the moment are : Jetpack Compose, KSP, Gradle plugins and many more !

I've contributed to some projects on Github and plan to contribute more when I have the time.

You can find more info on me on [my portfolio](https://valentinrocher.notion.site/Valentin-Rocher-Senior-Android-Developer-19a4d672fc004522bca1b8307c9a577d?pvs=4) !
